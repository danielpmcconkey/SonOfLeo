Feature: Account CRUD
    Service-level behavioral specs for creating, updating, and deactivating
    chart-of-accounts entries. All scenarios exercise the service layer.
    Structural constraints (FK, unique index) are covered separately in
    structural specs; these scenarios verify the service rejects invalid
    inputs with meaningful error messages before any DB round-trip where
    possible.

    Background:
        Given the ledger schema exists for account management
